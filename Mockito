1.Mocktio Setup.
2.SUT (System Under Test).
3.stub.
4.Mocking Objects.
5.discussed about Argument Matcher,Throwing exceptions,(when,thenReturn,thenThrow,mock methods).
6.Argument Matcher(pass any arg dynamically).
7.BDD(Behavior Driven Development) encourages writing tests in a natural, human-readable language that focuses on the behavior of the application.
8.verify() method is used to check whether the mock object's particular method is called or not(in case where a method returns nothing i.e., void).
for checking the side effects.
9.ArgumentCaptor is used to capture the argument passed to the method.

10.Hamcrest Matchers:
Hamcrest library provides methods which are easy to Understand, and improves the test readability,maintainable.

11.Mockito Annotations: with (@RunWith(MockitoJunitRunner.class))
@Mock --> Used to mock objects.
@InjectMock --> Used to inject mocked objects into dependent objects.
@Captor --> Used to create Argument Captor Object.

12.spy()--> Also called as partial mocking.Not preferred to use without necessary.


12.JUnit Rules. Using MockitoJUnit.rule() instead of @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class).
public MockitoRule rule=MockitoJunit.rule();
* With @RunWith annotation we cannot define more Runner classes, so @Rule annotation is used instead of it.
